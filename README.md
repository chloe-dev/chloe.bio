# [chloe.bio](https://chloe.bio) - Biography, Portfolio, and Blog

Source code, images, and other components of my personal website https://chloe.bio/.

The license is long to protect my content. I would much rather open-source everything I do, but this is attached to
my "brand" (myself). If there's something specific you have in mind (that violates the license as written), **please**
do not hesitate to contact me; I'll (likely) issue written permission with more granular discretion.
